# Whisper

Whisper is a Game Project of https://github.com/janmikusch & https://github.com/robinunger.
A Game Engine was built throughout our 3rd Semester at the Salzburg University of Applied Sciences.
With this engine we created Whisper in our 5-days project-week.

## GAMEPLAY
Whisper is a two-player cooperative game.
Player one can control the hero and needs to tell the other player what he can see and where he is.

Player two is supporting the other player. He has a (printed) version of the manual and needs to find out, how to solve every riddle-room, without looking at the screen of Player one.

The hero has 3 lives and 7 minutes to get out of the dungeon.
When all lives are lost, or the time is up, you will be imprisoned forever.

## Story
For many years now, villagers are telling the story of the old riddle-master. He created a riddle, that seems to be impossible to solve. Everybody in the empire tried to solve it but failed miserably.
As the king was trying to solve it, the riddle drove him crazy. After two moons, he gave up. In anger, he had a dungeon built, that was full of riddles and imprisoned the riddle-master.
"Only the one, who can solve all riddles shall escape."
Even the riddle-master was not able to solve them all. He was never seen again.

After many years, a young woman heads out to find the ruins of the old dungeon. In a great wood, she found the dungeon. After she entered, the door was locked.
Suddenly she heard a voice: " I will guide you. I have been walking around in here for many many years. I know the answer to every riddle in here. You shall not suffer the same fate. But we need to be quick, otherwise, the door will be locked forever!"
